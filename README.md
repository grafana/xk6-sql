# xk6-sql

This is a [k6](https://github.com/grafana/k6) extension using the
[xk6](https://github.com/grafana/xk6) system.

Supported RDBMSs: `mysql`, `postgres`, `sqlite3`, `sqlserver`. See the [tests](tests)
directory for examples. Other RDBMSs are not supported, see
[details below](#support-for-other-rdbmss).


## Build

To build a `k6` binary with this plugin, first ensure you have the prerequisites:

- [Go toolchain](https://go101.org/article/go-toolchain.html)
- If you're using SQLite, a build toolchain for your system that includes `gcc` or
  another C compiler. On Debian and derivatives install the `build-essential`
  package. On Windows you can use [tdm-gcc](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/).
  Make sure that `gcc` is in your `PATH`.
- Git

Then:

1. Install `xk6`:
  ```shell
  go install go.k6.io/xk6/cmd/xk6@latest
  ```

2. Build the binary:
  ```shell
  xk6 build --with github.com/grafana/xk6-sql
  ```

  If you're using SQLite, ensure you have a C compiler installed (see the
  prerequisites note) and set `CGO_ENABLED=1` in the environment:
  ```shell
  CGO_ENABLED=1 xk6 build --with github.com/grafana/xk6-sql
  ```

  On Windows this is done slightly differently:
  ```shell
  set CGO_ENABLED=1
  xk6 build --with github.com/grafana/xk6-sql
  ```

## Development
To make development a little smoother, use the `Makefile` in the root folder. The default target will format your code, run tests, and create a `k6` binary with your local code rather than from GitHub.

```bash
make
```
Once built, you can run your newly extended `k6` using:
```shell
 ./k6 run tests/sqlite3_test.js
 ```

## Example

```javascript
// script.js
import sql from 'k6/x/sql';

const db = sql.open("sqlite3", "./test.db");

export function setup() {
  db.exec(`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS keyvalues (
           id integer PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
           key varchar NOT NULL,
           value varchar);`);
}

export function teardown() {
  db.close();
}

export default function () {
  db.exec("INSERT INTO keyvalues (key, value) VALUES('plugin-name', 'k6-plugin-sql');");

  let results = sql.query(db, "SELECT * FROM keyvalues;");
  for (const row of results) {
    console.log(`key: ${row.key}, value: ${row.value}`);
  }
}
```

Result output:

```shell
$ ./k6 run script.js

          /\      |‾‾| /‾‾/   /‾‾/

### Support for other RDBMSs

Note that this project is not accepting support for additional SQL implementations
and RDBMSs. See the discussion in [issue #17](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-sql/issues/17)
for the reasoning.

There are however forks of this project that add additional support for:
- [Oracle](https://github.com/stefnedelchevbrady/xk6-sql-with-oracle)
- [Snowflake](https://github.com/libertymutual/xk6-sql)

You can build k6 binaries by simply specifying these project URLs in `xk6 build`.
E.g. `CGO_ENABLED=1 xk6 build --with github.com/stefnedelchevbrady/xk6-sql-with-oracle`.
Please report any issues with these extensions in their respective GitHub issue trackers,
and not in grafana/xk6-sql.


## Docker

For those who do not have a Go development environment available, or simply want
to run an extended version of `k6` as a container, Docker is an option to build
and run the application.

The following command will build a custom `k6` image incorporating the `xk6-sql` extension
built from the local source files.
```shell
docker build -t grafana/k6-for-sql:latest .
```
Using this image, you may then execute the [tests/sqlite3_test.js](tests/sqlite3_test.js) script
by running the following command:
```shell
docker run -v $PWD:/scripts -it --rm grafana/k6-for-sql:latest run /scripts/tests/sqlite3_test.js
```
For those on Mac or Linux, the `docker-run.sh` script simplifies the command:
```shell
./docker-run.sh tests/sqlite3_test.js
```
